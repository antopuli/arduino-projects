# Arduino Projects

This repository contains some small projects that I made while studying for the Arduino Fundamentals Certification. This is a list to directly see the details about them:
1. [Aereospace Interface](#aereospace-interface)

## Aereospace Interface

I simulated a small control panel with a button and lights. A green LED turns on until you click the button, then the green LED turns off and the other lights starts blinking. In the folder you find the logical and physical schemes.
