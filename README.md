# Arduino Projects

This repository contains some small projects that I made while studying for the Arduino Fundamentals Certification, for every of them you can find the source code, logical and physical schemes. This is a list to directly see the details about them:
1. [Aereospace Interface](#aereospace-interface)

## Aereospace Interface

### Introduction
I simulated a small control panel with a button and lights. A green LED turns on until you click the button, then the green LED turns off and the other lights starts blinking.

### Table of Components
| Name | Value | Quantity |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| Red LED |  | 2 |
| Green LED |  | 1 |
| Button |  | 1 |
| Arduino UNO Rev3 |  | 1 |
| Breadboard |  | 1 |
| Resistance | 220 Ohm | 3 |
| Resistance | 10k Ohm | 1 |

### Conclusion
The goal of the project was to understand how to control the digital pins and use Arduino to manage the circuit behavior.
